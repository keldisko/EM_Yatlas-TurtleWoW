Yatlas provides a minimap-based map of the world (reasonably high detail).
This addon is no-more supported by the initial developer as such any bugs or other issues are not fixable for now.


This Fork is For Turtle WoW Server only and requires a mod - patch-s.mpq to work as intended.
This should chnage with 1.18 patch release in the future. 

Download patch-s.mpq here - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lJCpBVT6T5f8LnnoLsLqK1nfjeyaSXK-/view?usp=drive_link

To install the addon use the "+ Add new addon" function in Turtle WoW Launcher or download it in release tab and extract the .7z in your "T-WOW install Directory"/Interface/AddOns folder.

To install the patch-s.mpq put it in your "T-WOW install Directory"/Data folder and make sure it's enabled in the Turtle WoW launcher Mods tab.





There are two different modes:

Normal View
===========

This view is somewhat similar to Atlas, and to move around right or left 
click and drag on the map itself. You can choose which map (currently
only Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms) at the top.  Also, using the 
scroll mouse button changes the zoom.  Mousing over points provides a 
tooltip with additional information.

To open this view, either click on the minimap button, set a keybinding
in your Key Bindings menu, or use the /yatlas command.


Fullscreen View
===========

This view is somewhat similar to the world map, and non-transparently
covers the entire screen. For the most part it is similar to the normal
view, such as movement being controlled by dragging the screen around and
scroll mouse button changing the zoom.  Mousing over points provides a 
tooltip with additional information.

To open this view, either set a key binding in your Key Bindings
menu, or use the /bigyatlas command.


If you have CTMapMod, Gatherer or MapNotes installed, it will shows
points from these addons as well.
